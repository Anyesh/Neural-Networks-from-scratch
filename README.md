# Neural Networks from scratch

This repository is for my own learning purpose.<br>
The goal is to learn how forward as well as backpropagation works in: <br>
- [x] 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron
- [x] 2. Convolutional Neural Networks
- [x] 3. Vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks
- [ ] 4. Long Short-Term Memory RNN
